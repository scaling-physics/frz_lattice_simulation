# FRZ Lattice Simulation

This project is a lattice simulation for studying the behavior of interacting particles on a 2D hexagonal lattice. The simulation is implemented on C++ and provides a framework for analyzing the properties and dynamics of the lattice system. 

## Installation

To use this simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone git@gitlab.gwdg.de:murray-group/frz_lattice_simulation.git

2. Compile main.cpp. 

3. Execute binary file with the following inputs: ./frz_lattice_model $J $alpha $FrzB_num $beta $index. In the scripts J=J_AA and beta = J_AB.
